`View Assets in Habitat-sim engine`_
====================================

When composing or editing assets for a habitat dataset, it would be helpful to see how they would be rendered in the Habitat-sim engine.  This can be difficult to accomplish without a lot of setup work, and this is made more difficult if Habitat-sim is not installed.
This tutorial describes the Asset Viewer tool, which exists as both a `Collab`_, and a pure python utility.

.. _Collab: <https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/blob/main/examples/tutorials/colabs/asset_viewer.ipynb>

.. code:: shell-session

    $ python path/to/habitat-sim/examples/tutorials/nb_python/asset_viewer.py


Here we initialize the :ref:`Simulator`. Note that we override default settings to use the internally defined "none" scene (which is empty), and the 3rd person camera, before we initialize the :ref:`Simulator`.

.. include:: ../../examples/tutorials/nb_python/asset_viewer.py
    :code: py
    :start-after: # [initialize]
    :end-before: # [/initialize]

`Upload an Asset and Choose it for Display`_
============================================

To specify the asset to be viewed, set 'object_to_view_path' to be the full path to the asset.  If executing this tool as a Google colab,
you can upload an asset file to a location in the directory structure to the left of the screen, as is shown in the image below.

.. include:: ../../examples/tutorials/nb_python/asset_viewer.py
    :code: py
    :start-after: # [specify_object]
    :end-before: # [/specify_object]

`View the Asset, and Correct Inappropriate Orientation`_
========================================================

This code will compose a video of the asset of user-specified length that will show a single revolution around the asset.

.. include:: ../../examples/tutorials/nb_python/asset_viewer.py
    :code: py
    :start-after: # [build_carousel_view]
    :end-before: # [/build_carousel_view]

Assets will be displayed enlarged to nearly fill the screen, regardless of their size.

.. image:: images/asset-viewer-images/asset-viewer-chefcan.gif
    :width: 40em

You may find that the asset is displayed on its side (this will often be the case if the asset is a stage).

.. image:: images/asset-viewer-images/asset-viewer-tilted-simple-room.gif
    :width: 40em


If this is the case, set orientation_correction to True.

.. image:: images/asset-viewer-images/asset-viewer-orient-corr.png
    :width: 60em

This will correct the orientation issues.
