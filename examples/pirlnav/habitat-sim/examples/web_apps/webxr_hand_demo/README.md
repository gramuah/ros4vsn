# Overview

This is a webapp that allows the user to enter a scene in VR. The user can then spawn various objects and interact with them by picking them up or touching them. Use the index trigger buttons to grab and the secondary trigger buttons to spawn.

# Known Issues

You may encounter memory access errors on Quest 2 or possibly other VR devices. Desktop browser VR emulation is unaffected. We speculate this is due to a recent Oculus browser update and a previously-hidden memory-alignment issue related to Emscripten and/or Magnum's TinyGLTF importer. We have a workaround for testing on Quest 2: strangely, you need to load the page while tethered to a desktop via ADB debugging (this avoids the crash). For a fix, we have some leads which we'll pursue as this project gets closer to deploying on Quest 2.

# Installation

1. `cd` to the main `habitat_sim` directory. Create a folder for the data, then download the hand demo data:
```bash
$ mkdir examples/web_apps/webxr_hand_demo/data
$ python -m habitat_sim.utils.datasets_download --uids webxr_hand_demo --data-path examples/web_apps/webxr_hand_demo/data
```
2. Follow [instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/blob/main/DETAILS.md#experimental-emscripten-webgl-and-web-apps) for installing and activating Emscripten, including `source path/to/emsdk_env.sh` or similar to configure env variables.
1. `cd` to `examples/web_apps/webxr_hand_demo` (this directory). Then run a script to transpile Habitat into JS, copy the resulting files over, and also copy over the JS utils files.
```bash
$ chmod +x build_and_install_habitat_sim_js.sh
$ ./build_and_install_habitat_sim_js.sh
```
To update the Habitat-sim library for the hand demo, you just need to rerun the second command.

# Testing
## VR emulation in your desktop browser, standalone

1. `cd` to `examples/web_apps/webxr_hand_demo` and http-serve the VR app folder:
```bash
$ python3 -m http.server
```
2. Install the [WebXR emulator](https://blog.mozvr.com/webxr-emulator-extension/) and then restart your browser.
1. Navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8000`
    - You can also add a URL parameter to choose the stage to spawn in. For instance, appending `?stage=remake_v0_JustBigStuff_00` at the end of the URL means that stage will be loaded. By default, if this parameter is not given, `remake_v0_JustBigStuff_00` will be the scene that is loaded. See the Project folder structure section for instructions on how to add stages.
1. Recommended: watch the dev console as the page loads.
1. Once loading is complete, click "Enter VR". You should see a stereo 3D view of a kitchen scene.
1. In Chrome Developer Tools, find the WebXR tab. From the device list, select Oculus Quest or similar. In the WebXR panel's 3D view, move the headset or controllers to emulate the VR experience.
1. At the bottom of the WebXR tab, click "Exit immersive".
1. Observe the logged head poses in the html textarea.

## VR on Quest 2 (or other headset)
1. Serve the content at a public URL. This has to be an HTTPS address because that is a requirement for WebXR (just serving it locally won't cut it either). You could upload this `webxr_hand_demo` folder to Amazon S3 or any web host. You might experience some issues uploading the files in `webxr_hand_demo/data` because they are symlinked. If that happens, upload the actual source files, then adjust the file structure to match `webxr_hand_demo/data`. [todo: step through how to host on AWS]
1. On Quest 2, open the browser and navigate to the URL. Use the Quest controller to click "Enter VR".
1. Exit immersive VR with the Quest 2 controller's home button.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter Habitat-sim build errors, make sure you have Emscripten properly installed and activated. Delete the build output folders (`habitat-sim/build_corrade-rc` and `habitat-sim/build_js`) and rebuild.

If the VR app fails to load in your desktop browser, look for errors in the browser dev console. Make sure you have data files installed properly, e.g. `habitat-sim/examples/web_apps/webxr_hand_demo/data/webxr_hand_demo_dataset/stages/remake_v0_JustBigStuff_00.glb`. Make sure the WebXR emulator is installed and accessible (e.g. as a tab in Chrome Developer Tools).

# Project folder structure
- `data/webxr_hand_demo_dataset` contains all the models that are used in the default setup, plus a few extra ReplicaCAD objects
    - `default.physics_config.json` contains the physics settings, e.g. gravitational acceleration.
    - `stages` contain the scene `.glb` files and their corresponding `.stage_config.json` files. In order to choose a scene other than `remake_v0_JustBigStuff_00`, you need to add its 2 files here.
    - `objects` contains the hand models as well as the ReplicaCAD objects that can be spawned. It also contains some extra objects you may use.
- `js` contains the JS source code of the hand demo site, as well as the JS transpiled version of Habitat-sim. These transpiled files need to be here (rather than `lib`, which would be more intuitive) due to some quirks in how `physics_worker_setup.js` loads `hsim_bindings.js`. Essentially, `importScripts` is being used to load `hsim_bindings.js`, which is basically equivalent to copying all the `hsim_bindings.js` code into `physics_worker_setup.js`. The `hsim_bindings.js` always code tries to get `hsim_bindings.wasm` from the same directory it is in, but since it's running from `js/`, it can't locate the file.
- `lib` contains some general use utils JS files that are copied over when you run `build_and_install_habitat_sim_js.sh`.
- `index.html` is the hosted site, and `style.css` is its stylesheet.

# Habitat-sim JS build

The Habitat-sim JS build is a webassembly build of the Habitat simulator. It's built by compiling Habitat-sim C++ code to webassembly using the Emscripten compiler. The build outputs are `hsim_bindings.js` and `hsim_bindings.wasm`. `hsim_bindings.js` can be included from Javascript and you can call into the simulator via the bindings defined in `habitat-sim/src/esp/bindings_js/bindings_js.cpp`.

We also utilize some JS utilities provided as .js files inside Habitat-sim. These are also copied from the Habitat-sim source folders to `examples/web_apps/webxr_hand_demo/lib` as part of the build script.
